# SyntheaWeb

SyntheaWeb is a platform developed for the Medical University of Vienna to simplify access to synthetic medical data generated by Synthea™. It supports researchers, students, and healthcare professionals by providing realistic, artificial datasets that prioritize privacy and comply with strict data protection regulations.

## What is Synthea?

[Synthea™](https://synthetichealth.github.io/synthea/) is an open-source synthetic patient generator developed by The MITRE Corporation. It creates realistic healthcare data for entire populations, simulating patient demographics and various aspects of medical care. These datasets are entirely fictional, making them ideal for research, education, and software testing without compromising real patient privacy.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface** – Generate synthetic healthcare data via an intuitive web interface.
- **Support for Research & Education** – Promote advancements in healthcare and data science while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.
- **Fully Containerized Deployment** – Runs via Docker without requiring manual installation of dependencies.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Docker/Docker Desktop with WSL2** and **Docker-Compose** installed on your system.

Follow the official installation guide for Docker: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

For Docker-Compose: [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### **Run SyntheaWeb with Docker**

1. **Make sure that Docker/Docker Desktop are running.**

2. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/adnanjoun/web_sythn.git
   cd SyntheaWeb
   ```
3. **(Optional) Change credentials in the included .env file**
4. **Start the application:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   The first build takes a few minutes.

5. **Open the application.**

   Once all containers are running and it shows:

   ```sh
   synthea exited with code 0
   ```

   open a browser and visit:
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. **Now you can register and start generating!**

**Note**: The first Synthea run generation takes longer since gradle needs to build first.
